Offers
Part of Ascenda travel platform is to find nearby offers for our customers. When a user books a hotel using Ascenda travel platform, we find nearby offers around the hotel customer booked and send those offers in the booking confirmation email. So when the customer stays at the hotel, he can enjoy nearby offers from Restaurants, Retail stores & Tourist Activity places.

For that purpose, we are using an external partner API to fetch offers. For this external API, we can provide the latitude & longitude values of the location & radius by kilometers to filter the offers.

For example: https://61c3deadf1af4a0017d990e7.mockapi.io/offers/near_by?lat=1.313492&lon=103.860359&rad=20

And this API returns us a JSON response including offer details & merchant details.

Merchants giving these offers are categorized by the external partner. In our travel platform, we only show a few selected categories even though API returns us more.

The exercise
Given that the JSON response mentioned above is already loaded inside a file input.json, implement a command line application that:

Accept an argument which is the customer check-in date with the format: YYYY-MM-DD
Load the input.json file
Filter the offers via the following rules:
Only select offers with category that is Restaurant, Retail or Activity. Category ID mapping is

Restaurant: 1 
Retail: 2
Hotel: 3
Activity: 4
Offer needs to be valid till checkin date + 5 days. (valid_to is in YYYY-MM-DD)

If an offer is available in multiple merchants, only select the closest merchant

This class should only return 2 offers even though there are several eligible offers

Both final selected offers should be in different categories. If there are multiple offers in the same category give priority to the closest merchant offer.

If there are multiple offers with different categories, select the closest merchant offers when selecting 2 offers

Finally, save the filtered offers to a file output.json (stored at the root of the project)
For example:

Given the check-in date is 2019-12-25 and input.json has following content:

{
  "offers": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "title": "Offer 1",
      "description": "Offer 1 description",
      "category": 1,
      "merchants": [
        {
          "id": 1,
          "name": "Offer1 Merchant1",
          "distance": 0.5
        }
      ],
      "valid_to": "2020-02-01"
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "title": "Offer 2",
      "description": "Offer 2 description",
      "category": 2,
      "merchants": [
        {
          "id": 2,
          "name": "Offer2 Merchant1",
          "distance": 1.3
        }
      ],
      "valid_to": "2019-12-01"
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "title": "Offer 3",
      "description": "Offer 3 description",
      "category": 2,
      "merchants": [
        {
          "id": 3,
          "name": "Offer3 Merchant1",
          "distance": 0.8
        },
        {
          "id": 4,
          "name": "Offer3 Merchant2",
          "distance": 0.9
        }
      ],
      "valid_to": "2020-01-01"
    },
    {
      "id": 4,
      "title": "Offer 4",
      "description": "Offer 4 description",
      "category": 3,
      "merchants": [
        {
          "id": 5,
          "name": "Offer4 Merchant1",
          "distance": 0.3
        }
      ],
      "valid_to": "2020-05-01"
    },
    {
      "id": 5,
      "title": "Offer 5",
      "description": "Offer 5 description",
      "category": 4,
      "merchants": [
        {
          "id": 6,
          "name": "Offer5 Merchant1",
          "distance": 1.2
        }
      ],
      "valid_to": "2020-05-01"
    },
    {
      "id": 6,
      "title": "Offer 6",
      "description": "Offer 6 description",
      "category": 2,
      "merchants": [
        {
          "id": 7,
          "name": "Offer6 Merchant1",
          "distance": 1.3
        }
      ],
      "valid_to": "2020-05-01"
    }
  ]
}
Then the expected output.json has the following content:

{
  "offers": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "title": "Offer 1",
      "description": "Offer 1 description",
      "category": 1,
      "merchants": [
        {
         "id": 1,
         "name": "Offer1 Merchant1",
         "distance": 0.5
        }
      ],
      "valid_to": "2020-02-01"
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "title": "Offer 3",
      "description": "Offer 3 description",
      "category": 2,
      "merchants": [
        {
         "id": 3,
         "name": "Offer3 Merchant1",
         "distance": 0.8
        }
      ],
      "valid_to": "2020-01-01"
    }
  ]
}
The final result returns Offer ID 1 with Merchant ID 1 & Offer ID 3 with Merchant ID 3 because:

Offer ID 2 is not valid until the check-in date
Offer ID 4 is not an eligible category
Offer ID 3 has two merchants, the closest merchant is merchant id 3. So remove merchant id 4
So we have Offer id 1, 3, 5, 6 with category id 1, 2, 4, 2
Offer ID 3 & 6 have the same category id 2. So we choose Offer ID 3 because Offer 3 merchants are closer
So we have Offer IDs 1, 3, 5. We need to choose only 2 of 3 offers.
Offer ID 1 & 3 are the closest from 3 of them.
Requirements
We expect that you don’t use any major framework for building back-end or front-end applications. This round is mainly for evaluating your problem-solving aspect by applying foundational computer science knowledge.

Note that we’re quite keen on the notion of “don’t reinvent the wheel”, so even though major frameworks are not allowed, you’re free to use any library to support your core logic. And you can work on the exercise using any programming language of your choice.

In order to help us evaluate your submission, do provide a README.MD to explain how we can setup the environment and run your application

Submission
Once you finish the exercise, upload your code to a public repository (e.g. GitHub, GitLab, etc.) then send us the repository link via email.

Grading criteria
For grading your submission, we take these points into account:

Is the logic fully correct? Are edge cases taken into account?
